##Dedication

We, the engineers at Polydojo, are thankful to the following:

+ [Javascript: The Good Pargs](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0596517742/wrrrldwideweb), by [Douglas Crockford](http://www.crockford.com/).
    - This book introduced us to the wonders of functional programming.
    - It made it clear that beneath all the Java-like nonsense, JavaScript is beautiful.
    - It gave us a new perspective, that of prototypal programming.
+ [Lispy](http://norvig.com/lispy.html) - (How to Write a (Lisp) Interpreter (in Python)), by [Peter Norvig](http://norvig.com/).
    - This essay amazed, intrigued and inspired us.
    - It planted our my heads, the idea of writing our own interpreter.
    - It gave us the confidence that doing so will not be impossible.
+ [Programming Languages (CS262)](https://www.udacity.com/course/cs262), a Udacity course by [Westley Weimer](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~weimer/).
    - This course served as an formal introduction to programming languages.
    - It introduced the ideas of regular expressions, lexing, parsing and interpreting.
    - Though Jispy doesn't follow CS262's *exact* track, it was extremely helpful.

***We deeply thank and respectfully dedicate this project to Douglas Crockford, Peter Norvig and Westley Weimer.***  
It wouldn't have been possible without them.
