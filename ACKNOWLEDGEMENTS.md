Jispy has two primary influences:

+ [**Lispy**](http://norvig.com/lispy.html) - (A (Lisp) Interpreter (in Python)) by [**Peter Norvig**](http://norvig.com/).
+ [**Javascript: The Good Pargs**](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0596517742/wrrrldwideweb), by [**Douglas Crockfork**](http://www.crockford.com/).

This project is respectfully dedicated to them. (Hope they don't mind.)
